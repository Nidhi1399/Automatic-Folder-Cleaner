# Automatic-Folder-Cleaner
create a Python folder organizer application. This application is very useful when you need to organize a folder which has a lot of files. So let's starts.

Let's create a demo folder where we will put random files like 1.txt, w.jpg, index.html etc.
Now open the folder in your favourite IDE.
Now create a main.py file inside the folder.
Now we are going to create the application. We are going to use the OS module to make folders and sort the file into the folders. The OS module will list the contents of the directory and then it will sort the files by using their extension. After sorting it will put the files in its respective folders
